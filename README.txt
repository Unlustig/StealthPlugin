This is a little plugin which will include some different stealth mechanics in one plugin.


ToDo:

- "Ninja-Suit" which makes u invisible while sneaking, configurable cooldown and maximum stealth-time, maybe the suite takes damage when stealthing so it breaks faster.
- get your name hidden if you are in an area with low lightlevel (configurable of course)
- be completly hidden in 0 lightlevel and sneaking.
- WorldGuard region support (will need customflags api i guess)
- bonus damage when "assassinating"(attacking out of stealth)
- a special sword which increases the "assissination" damage even more

more to come, maybe from bukkit plugin site comments.
